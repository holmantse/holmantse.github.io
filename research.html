<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>My research focuses on sound change in contact (multilingual or multidialectal) settings. Some questions addressed in my research include the following:
</p>

<ul><li>How do the sound (phonetic and phonological) systems of individual languages vary across speakers in multilingual settings?</li>
<li>How do these systems develop and change over time under influence from other languages?</li>
<li>What are the linguistic (language internal) and non-linguistic (language external) factors involved in shaping the linguistic outcomes of sound change in multilingual settings? 
</li>

<li>Can we distinguish between internally motivated and externally motivated change in intense contact settings?</li>

<li>Is sound change in multilingual settings really different from sound change in monolingual settings? Or could distinct linguistic outcomes be due to the availability of a larger linguistic feature pool (cf. Mufwene 2001) in multilingual settings?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are research questions that cut across several different subfields of linguistics including:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Historical linguistics</strong>: How and why languages changes over time is, of course, central to the subfield.</li>

<li><strong>Sociolinguistics</strong>: Variationist sociolinguistics as developed by the work of Bill Labov introduced a new way of approaching historical linguistics through the Uniformitarian Principle. Can we develop a better idea of how and why languages change over time through the study of variation in present-day speech communities? More recent work has considered how social meaning fits into the puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Phonetics/phonology</strong>: Actual speech production and the sound systems of individual languages are the linguistic focus of my research. 
</li>

<li><strong>Bilingualism and multilingualism</strong>: Are multilingual individuals multiple monolinguals in one? How does individual bilingualism/multilingualism relate to societal bilingualism/multilingualism? 
</li>

<li><strong>Contact linguistics</strong>: How can one language influence another?</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="major"></a>Major Projects</h3>

<p>The empirical basis of my research has come mainly from two major projects.</p>

<h4><a name="hlvc"></a>HLVC Cantonese</h4>

<p>My dissertation (<a href="publications.html#T5">[T5]</a>) is based on data from the <a href="http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/ngn/HLVC/0_0_home.php">Heritage Language Variation and Change (HLVC) in Toronto Project</a>.</p>

<p>Inspired by studies of vowel variation and change across dialects of English, I chose to focus my research on vowels in Cantonese. Studies of English vowels have formed the empirical basis behind many theoretical ideas about sound change. Many of these studies have shown that vowel variation lies below the level of conscious awareness. In other words, vowel pronunciation differences are not as easily noticeable by speakers as are other pronunciation features such as consonants or prosodic features. Few variationist studies, however, have focused on vowels in languages other than English. What kind of patterns of vowel variation can we find in other languages? To what extent can principles of vowel variation and change developed for English (and Indo-European languages) be generalizable to other languages?</p>

<p>Cantonese (and especially Cantonese under contact with English) seemed like an ideal language to address these questions. Cantonese is one of 8+ heritage languages that is part of the HLVC corpus. It has a large vowel inventory like English. Most studies of Cantonese variation have focused on consonants. My work on this project began with a consideration of methodological issues. In collaboration with researchers at Toronto, I experimented with the use of forced-alignment, which has become increasingly common in studies of English (see <a href="presentations.html#O6">[O6]</a> and <a href="presentations.html#O11">[O11]</a>). A pilot project turned into the second comprehensive paper required for my PhD: <a href="publications.html#T4">[T4]</a>. This study focused on a subset of vowels measured without the help of forced alignment. It also developed into two publications: <a href="publications.html#A4">[A4]</a> and <a href="publications.html#A5">[A5]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main findings was lack of phonological mergers (though more recent work has shown the opposite for a subset of speakers!). The few changes that were identified were low-level phonetic differences including allophonic splits. In describing language change in contact settings, I have argued against the dichotomy between conservativeness and innovativeness: <a href="presentations.html#O9">[O9]</a>, <a href="presentations.html#"O12>[O12]</a>, <a href="presentations.html#O13">[O13]</a>. Allophonic splits are particularly interesting because of the relatively few that have been observed in variationist studies. This was a point I made in <a href="presentations.html#O10">[O10]</a>, which developed into a publication: <a href="publications.html#A4">[A4]</a>.</p>

<p>The data processing for my dissertation research <a href="publications.html#T5">[T5]</a> involved using forced alignment. This made it possible to analyze 33,179 vowel tokens from 32 different speakers (24 from Toronto and 8 from Hong Kong). In the first paper published based on my most recent analysis <a href="publications.html#A6">[A6]</a>, I found evidence for vowel shifting consistent with Labov's Principles of Vowel Chain Shifting in Hong Kong but not in Toronto. In Toronto, there is evidence of phonological influence from English. One of these phonologically influenced changes is a change towards merger of the two high round vowels in Cantonese: /y/ and /u/. See <a href="presentations.html#O14">[O14]</a> and <a href="presentations.html#P3">[P3]</a>. Interestingly, these results differ from what was presented in <a href="presentations.html#P1">[P1]</a>.</p>

<p>The other phonologically influenced change is an allophonic split in the front mid unrounded vowel in Cantonese. It appears to be influenced by a similar allophonic split found in many dialects of North American English (including Toronto) that involves fronting/raising of the vowel in words like BAN or BANG, but retraction in words like BACK. This split was identified in my earlier work based on a smaller set of data: <a href="publications.html#A4">[A4]</a>, <a href="presentations.html#O10">[O10]</a>. This split was also the focus of several recent presentations: <a href="presentations.html#P2">[P2]</a>, <a href="presentations.html#P3">[P3]</a>, and <a href="presentations.html#O15">[O15]</a></p>

<p>I am currently working on articles that focus on these phonologically influenced changes. One thing that is clear is that not all Toronto speakers are developing these changes. The question is what specific factors make a speaker more likely to innovate such changes. These changes appear to be tied closely to individual speaker proficiency rather than individual linguistic dominance as I noted in <a href="presentations.html#P3">[P3]</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="kizigua"></a>Kizigua (aka Chizigula)</h4>

<p>Kizigua is an under-documented language from East Africa involved in a history of multiple migrations (from present-day Tanzania to present-day Somalia in the 19the century, then from Somalia to Kenya and to cities across the US after the start of the Somali Civil War). My work initially began as part of the Field Methods course at the University of Pittsburgh. My first published paper focused on methodological issues that arise when working on small language communities from a sociolinguistic perspective. <a href="publications.html#A1">[A1]</a> From that point on, my focus shifted to the sounds of the Somali dialect and how they developed from the Tanzanian dialect, which was documented by a missionary in the early 20th century (Kisbey 1906). </p>

<p>I presented some rough ideas in <a href="publications.html#A2">[A2]</a> and developed them further in <a href="publications.html#A3">[A3]</a>. In both of these papers, I focused specifically on what appeared to be retroflex sounds (though Temkin Martinez & Rosenbaum 2017 have shown that they are not actually retroflex. Nevertheless, it is still clear that they are typologically rare sounds).</p>

<p><a href="publications.html#A3">[A3]</a> benefited from my time as part of a FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies) Fellowship. During this time, I took Swahili courses and studied existing documentation of the history of East Africa and the languages spoken in this region. As a related language, studying Swahili was helpful in better understanding Kizigua and especially in seeing the similarities that speakers see not only between Kizigua and Swahili but also between Kizigua and other Bantu languages. This made me think about language ideology and how linguistic boundaries (as well as the lack of boundaries in some cases including this one) are socially constructed and how this could play a role in sound change. What soon became clear was that many of the distinct Bantu languages historically spoken in the southern part of present-day Somalia may not have been seen as distinct to speakers.</p>

<p>In <a href="presentations.html#O7">[O7]</a>, I discussed how similarity along with language shift among some speakers of other Bantu varieties may have played a facilitative role in sound change. I developed these ideas further in <a href="presentations.html#O8">[O8]</a> and this ultimately led to <a href="publications.html#A3">[A3]</a>, my most recent publication on the language. The ideas I presented in <a href="presentations.html#O7">[O7]</a>, <a href="presentations.html#O8">[O8]</a>, and <a href="publications.html#A3">[A3]</a> have important theoretical ramifications because of the traditional dichotomy between internally-motivated change and contact-induced change. Essentially, I showed how an internally-motivated pattern can be contact-induced. Another angle I have considered recently is how phonological splits can develop in contact settings: <a href="presentations.html#O15">[O15]</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="other"></a>Other Projects and Interests</h3>

<p>My BA thesis <a href="publications.html#T1">[T1]</a> was on language ideology in China. The theoretical framework of this paper was based on ideas developed by linguistic anthropologists. More recently, I have been thinking about how ideologies of linguistic boundaries (or lack of boundaries) can play a role in structuring language change (or lack of change in some cases) from a cross-cultural perspective.</p>

<p>My MA thesis <a href="publications.html#T2">[T2]</a> was an experimental study addressing whether or not lexical tones (as phonological categories) can have an effect on the phonetic implementation of Voice Onset Time (VOT) in Cantonese. This ties into the phonetics-phonology interface problem. In a more recent manuscript incorporating F0 data, I strengthen the argument for a lexical tone effect: <a href="publications.html#U1">[U1]</a></p>

<p>I have also studied sociophonetic variation in Jamaican Creole stops: <a href="publications.html#U2">[U2]</a></p>

<p>I am also interested in dialectology and in particular how different immigrant groups can contribute to the development of regional dialects. See my review of Barbara Johnstone's book on Pittsburghese: <a href="publications.html#R2">[R2]</a></p>
