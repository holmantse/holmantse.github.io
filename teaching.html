<h2>Language Studies Courses At St. Kate's</h2>

<p>Language Studies at St. Kate's includes courses in general linguistics and sociolinguistics. All Language Studies courses are designated as either ENGL 2400+ or ENGL 3400+ level courses. Some are also cross-listed with other departments. All of these courses fulfill requirements or count as elective options for majors in English, ASL, and Interpreting, and minors in General English and TESL. St. Kate's also offers a Language Studies minor, which requires four 2400/3400 level courses and one course in another area of ENGL (Literature or Writing).</p>

"This class will take students into the complex and often hidden intersections of language and power, focusing on the many ways in which language serves as a tool of power. It will examine how people negotiate power on several levels, both individually and socially; how words imply more than they say (and thus can be used to manipulate); how language policies in education and other societal institutions privilege some groups while oppressing others; and how oppressed groups use language to resist their oppression. Because language is so intimately tied to the communities that use it, we will examine language use through the lenses of race/ethnicity and gender among others. Also offered as CRST 3401W and WOST 3400W. This class counts as one of the four Writing Intensive courses required for graduation. Does not meet the liberal arts core requirement in literature.
Prerequisite: ENGL 2402. Not open to first-year students. Offered in the College for Women and the College for Adults."</p>

"This course focuses on English as a global language, tracing its history from Old English to Early Modern English to its spread around the world and its subsequent pluralization into many unique and diverse Englishes, from Jamaica to India, Nigeria to Singapore. The course looks at how English has changed over time as well as how and why English spread. It examines the reasons for its spread and the forces that helped propel English to its current position, as well as shift the status of other languages, including standard language ideology, linguistic imperialism, and linguicism. The course also looks at the use of English today in education, health, science, business, and politics, both in its capacity as an official language in 88 countries as well as its role as an international lingua franca. It also examines various social justice issues resulting from its current status, such as unequal access to English language education, discriminatory attitudes toward localized varieties of English, and the endangered status of other languages. Finally, the course explores several seminal works in World Englishes literature that reflect localized varieties of English in different ways. Also offered as CRST. Offered in the College for Women."</p>

"This course is an introduction to the descriptive findings, methods, and theories of variationist
sociolinguistics, a subfield focused on the study of language variation and change (LVC). As in
other areas of linguistics, linguistic structure is an important concern. How is language organized
and structured? How did particular languages end up the way they do? The specific focus of
LVC, however, is on language variation as observable in the present-day. How and why do
languages vary? Does variation lead to change over time? How does this happen? In order to
answer these questions, we need to consider methods. An important part of this course is hands-
on learning and application of the methods used by variationists to study language change in
progress. This includes the sociolinguistic interview, coding and transcription of interviews, and
analysis of data. Completion of this course satisfies the Methods requirement for Linguistics
majors and counts as one of the four elective courses required for Linguistics minors."</p>
